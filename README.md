 Unsupervised-Machine_Learning-Homework
 
 
 I have done two different PCAs: the first found only one dimension accounted for .999 of variability.
 Therefore, I did a second specifying 4 dimensions and use t-SNE on that, which reduced it to two and allowed
 me something to visualize.

 Given the analysis below, I would advise against creating a cryptocurrency investment portfolio. The truth 
 is that only one dimension accounts for nearly all variability. K-means testing showed that 3 clusters would 
 be appropriate. However, with only one component, visualization was not possible. Even using more dimensions 
 and t-SNE does not show any clear clusters. This market needs to mature more and allow for greater differentiation.

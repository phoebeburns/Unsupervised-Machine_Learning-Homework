# Unsupervised-Machine_Learning-Homework

# The goal of this analysis is to see whether it would be worthwhile to create a cryptocurrency investment portfolio. The data
# was preprocessed, then run through a PCA model to see what dimensions of the dataframe were the most important to the analysis.
# The final number of columns was three. Then K-means testing was done. Three clusters were found, with one holdint the vast
# majority of cryptocurrencies. Only six of 477 points were not in the main cluster. I recommended against creating the portfolio.
